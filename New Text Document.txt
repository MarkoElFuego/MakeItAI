}

{
  "answer": "To make a paper flower, you can create several types depending on what you have available. The most basic method involves cutting petals from colored paper, shaping them, and assembling them around a stem using glue.\n\nHere are the general steps:\n\n1. Cut petals from your chosen colored paper (the number varies by flower type)\n2. Shape each petal by gently pushing with your thumb or curling with a pencil\n3. Attach petals to a wire or dowel stem using hot glue\n4. Add leaves cut from green paper\n5. Wrap the stem with floral tape or paper strips to finish\n\nThe books provide specific instructions for roses, daffodils, kusudama, and buttonholes, each with different techniques for shaping and assembly.\n\n(Source: Creating Flowers and Daffodil sections)",

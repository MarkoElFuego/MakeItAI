Repeat this process on the opposite side of the cover, attaching a second hinge. B. Hold the first inner frame facedown (making sure the top is oriented properly) and slip it in between the last two folds on both sides of the hinge. Carefully apply glue to the back side of the last hinge panel and glue the hinge onto the back of the frame on both sides: Don’t be too concerned if the exposed panels fail to line up exactly with the edges of the frame—push the edges of the frame snuggly into the folds of the side hinges on both sides and glue the frame in place.

Numbers '1', '2', and '3' are placed on different sections of the net, likely indicating faces or assembly points. A key on the left explains that dotted lines represent folds and hatched lines represent glue tabs."

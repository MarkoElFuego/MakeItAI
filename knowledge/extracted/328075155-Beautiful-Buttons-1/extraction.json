If you put the fabric in the frame the wrong way round with the larger ring under the fabric and the small one on top, you can use an ordinary embroidery frame. Depending on the size of the fabric, you can also work with just the embroidery fleece or embroidery foil without a frame. Lower or cover the feed dogs (refer to the instructions for your machine) and insert an embroidery or quilting foot. Loosen the upper thread slightly so that the lower thread does not show on the front. Choose the lower thread in the matching colour, just to be on the safe side. Sewing machine embroidery thread is best: it is a little thicker and shinier than normal sewing thread, and creates brighter results. With the fabric in the embroidery frame, you can move it freely under the sewing foot. The pre-drawn buttons are ideal for this technique. Make sure your stitches aren't too short. A stitch length of 2–2.5mm (13 stitches per inch) will show the thread at its best. If you want to embroider areas and contours, the contours will be much clearer if you sew them at the end.

Place the felt fibres on the felt base, then start by gently rubbing the felting needle all over the fibres in the fabric, and then gradually build up the pressure. This will gradually produce a fuzz on the back of the fabric. For non-detachable buttons or buttons on smooth, loosely woven fabrics, be sure to wet felt the felt fibres on both sides of the fabric. Soak the fibres in hot, soapy water and rub together to felt them. Work very gently at first using small movements until the fibres have felted and can no longer slip. Now increase the pressure and use bigger movements.",

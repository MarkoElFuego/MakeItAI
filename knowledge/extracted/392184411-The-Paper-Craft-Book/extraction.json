Above the central photo frame, three white buttons of different sizes are glued vertically. To the top right of the central photo frame, a silver pleated rosette with a light blue heart in its center is attached, with a blue ribbon extending downwards. A white scalloped lace-like trim runs horizontally above the central photo frame.

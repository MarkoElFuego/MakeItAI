Score equally spaced vertical lines on several sheets of paper. The more sheets you use and the wider the lines, the bigger the fan will be. Use the guides on your cutting mat to make sure the lines are straight.\n2. Apply PVA glue to the bottom segment of one sheet of paper. Stick the top segment of another sheet of paper on top so they overlap. Allow to dry and then repeat with the other sheets (minimum of two).\n3. Fold the papers along the scored creases to create an accordion effect.\n4. Repeat this process with slimmer sheets of paper of a different color. When done, lay them flat and cut shapes into the folds to add detail.\n5. Repeat again with another thinner paper. However, instead of cutting a design in the folds, slice the ends off diagonally.\n6. Glue the third paper along the bottom edge of the fan. Make sure to take your time to ensure the edges align properly.\n\n7. Apply PVA glue to one end, then bring the two sides of the accordion together to form a large circle.\n\n8. Lay the fan on greaseproof paper and use a hot glue gun to create a pool of glue in the center, if desired.\n\nNote: The original text contained many errors and inconsistencies, but I have done my best to correct it and make it readable.\n\nUsing both hands, carefully squeeze the tan inward so that the centre moves toward the glue and shrinks. Hold in place until the glue sets, then peel away the greaseproof paper. Neatly cut out the discs.\n\nHANGING FAN\n\nTurn the fan on its back and stick the plain disc to the centre with hot glue. Fold a ribbon in half, place the opposite ends on top, then secure in place with a strip of paper and some PVA glue.

This includes the central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and storage devices.\n\nThe first electronic computers were developed in the 1940s, using vacuum tubes as their main component. These early computers were massive and unreliable, but they paved the way for future developments.\n\nIn the 1950s, transistors replaced vacuum tubes, leading to smaller, faster, and more reliable machines. The mini-computer era began in the 1960s, with the introduction of small-scale integrated circuits (ICs).\n\nThe microcomputer revolution started in the 1970s, when personal computers were introduced. These early PCs used ICs and keyboard interfaces to process information.\n\nThe 1980s saw the rise of personal computers with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), such as Apple's Macintosh and Microsoft's Windows.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, computer hardware continued to evolve with advancements in processor speed, memory capacity, and storage capabilities. Modern computers now use a range of technologies, including CPUs, GPUs, and solid-state drives (SSDs).\n\n---\n\nNote: I corrected the text by removing unnecessary lines, garbled characters, and misspellings, and reformatted it to read naturally.\n\nHere is the corrected text:\n\nScribbling: A Creative Guide to Scrapbooking\n\nIntroduction\n\n129\nPage 1\n\n\nScribbling: A Creative Guide to Scrapbooking\n\nYou will need:\n\n\n Rosettes: A Comprehensive Guide\n\nHere is the corrected text:\n\n---\n\nPaper, Simple but eye-catching, rosettes are a great way to adorn your pages and add a little extra charm.
